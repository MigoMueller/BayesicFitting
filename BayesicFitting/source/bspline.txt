The python modules bspline.py and splinelab.py are enhanced copies of
the bspline package of John Foster and Juha Jeronen, at
http://github.com/johnfoster/bspline.

Bsplines have a set of knots, ordered over the domain of interest for
the inputs, x.
The original bspline package was defined strictly on the domain 
	knots[0] <= x < knots[-1]

So when some x value was exactly equal to the value of the last knot, it
gave an error message.

This version is enhanced in the sense that the bsplines are defined for
	knots[0] <= x <= knots[-1]
including the last knot.
