BayesicFitting is a toolbox for the fitting of models to data in a Bayesian way.

Data in this context means a set of (measured) points x and y. 
The model provides some (mathematical) relation between the x and y.
Fitting adapts the model such that certain criteria are optimized.

The BayesicFitting toolbox also answers the question whether one model fits 
the data better than another. Especially this latter aspect raises Bayesian 
fitting above other model fitting procedures.


BayesicFitting consists of more than 100 Python classes, of which a third are model
classes. Another third are fitters in one guise or another and miscelleaneous stuff.
The remaining third is needed for Nested Sampling, a novel way to solve Bayesian
inference problems, developed by John Skilling and David MacKay.

The package is stored at [github](https://github.com/dokester/BayesicFitting)
and [pypi](https://pypi.org/project/BayesicFitting/).
The easiest way to install it is via

> pip install BayesicFitting


This site is dedicated to documentation. It contains a manual about the 
use of the package and a reference manual with details about each class.
A design document about the structure of the package. A glossary
defining the term used and a help document about restrictions and trouble
shooting. All can be found in the sidebar.  

The pictures below are a few examples of what can achieved with the 
toolbox. More extensive information on them can be found in the 
[examples](https://github.com/dokester/BayesicFitting/tree/master/BayesicFitting/examples)
section.
